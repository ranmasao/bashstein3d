# BashStein3D

It is silly and fun attempt to port great game in a very strange way. All textures were downscaled to lower data size for parser.

## Requirements

Bash, bc, resize, terminal with UTF-8 and 256 colors, mono font is mandatory, 8x16 font or any other 1:2 is preferred.

## Was tested at

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64, GNOME terminal.

## May not work at

* Non-X11 console, especially with non-standard resolution;
* UNIX, MacOS, Android terminal, Cygwin, etc...
* ¯\\_\_(ツ)_\_/¯

## Install

chmod +x wolf.sh

## Run

./wolf.sh

## Controls

* WASD - movement
* Ctrl+C - exit

## ToDo

* Dynamic or locked window resolution;
* Change all math to fixed-point (because Bash can work only with integers), remove bc from dependencies;
* Doors;
* Sprites;
* Bonuses;
* Menus;
* Secret doors;
* Weapons;
* Enemies.

### When

Who knows, maybe never.
